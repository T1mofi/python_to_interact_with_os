How did you find yesterday’s challenge day? Unless you’re an undiscovered programming prodigy there’s a good chance you made a few mistakes along the way, and there’s even a good chance your app still has a couple of bugs in that you might not have noticed yet.

And you know what? That’s OK. Donald Knuth – computer science professor emeritus at Stanford – once wrote, “beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.” And if even Donald Knuth warns people of potential bugs, I think it’s OK if we have a few of our own.

Today we’re moving onto our second project, so it’s back to the overview day so we can look at some new SwiftUI techniques. It’s another easy project, but you’ll be learning so many core SwiftUI techniques that you’ll be using for years to come.

The end.
